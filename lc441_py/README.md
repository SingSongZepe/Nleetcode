You have n coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of k rows where the ith row has exactly i coins. The last row of the staircase may be incomplete.

Given the integer n, return the number of complete rows of the staircase you will build.

 

Example 1:
![](./res/img/i1.png)

Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
Example 2:
![](./res/img/i2.png)


Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
 

Constraints:

1 <= n <= 231 - 1
